                    I am Guilherme Passos, a Software Engineering student with a passion for technology and continuous learning. 
                    I thrive in problem-solving environments and enjoy working with diverse technologies to create meaningful solutions. 
                    Currently, I'm advancing my skills in web development, data structures, and algorithms.

                <p>
                    With experience in both frontend and backend development, I focus on building user-friendly, responsive applications. 
                    I am committed to refining my craft and am always open to learning new methodologies and improving my existing capabilities.

                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, I’m exploring different cultures and languages, which I find essential in broadening my perspective 
                    and enhancing my problem-solving approaches.
